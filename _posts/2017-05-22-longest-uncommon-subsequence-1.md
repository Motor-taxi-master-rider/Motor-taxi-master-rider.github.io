# Description
Given a group of **two** strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this group of two strings. **The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.**

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be **the length of the longest uncommon subsequence**. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "aba", "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" (or "cdc"),
because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba",
but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings.
```

**Note:**

1. Both strings' lengths will not exceed 100.
2. Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.

# Best practice

>这其实是个很憨厚的问题。
For strings A, B, when len(A) > len(B), the longest possible subsequence of either A or B is A, and no subsequence of B can be equal to A. Answer: len(A).
When len(A) == len(B), the only subsequence of B equal to A is B; so as long as A != B, the answer remains len(A).
When A == B, any subsequence of A can be found in B and vice versa, so the answer is -1.


Python version

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findLUSlength(self, a, b):
        """
        :type a: str
        :type b: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if a == b:
            return -1
        return max(len(a), len(b))
```

**Mark:** 45ms
