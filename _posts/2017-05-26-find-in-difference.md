```c++
class Solution {
public:
	char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
		char r = 0;
		for (char c : s) r ^= c;
		for (char c : t) r ^= c;
		return r;
	}
};
```

    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        asc=0;
        for item in t:
            asc+=ord(item)
        for item in s:
            asc-=ord(item)
        return chr(asc)

        ans = 0
        for c in s + t:
            ans ^= ord(c)
        return chr(ans)
